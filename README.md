# Hackthon-5.0
Our Project is related to bioinformatic where we optimized the performance of ViennaRNA's software package RNAfold which is used to calculate the secondary structure of RNA (used in medical research) and if there are complex jobs to run on then it takes a lot of time to execute so we have an idea of that can be useful in future to get quick result.
